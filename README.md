<h1><b>Forest Fire Smoke Detection</b></h1><br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
This project focuses on detecting smoke from forest fires using computer vision techniques. The system utilizes YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art object detection model, trained specifically to identify smoke patterns associated with forest fires from images and video feeds.
